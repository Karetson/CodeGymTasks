My personal training with Code Gym(Premium) to be a better programmer. <br />
All tasks are marked with the level of difficulty - Easy, Medium and Hard. <br />

- Collections (List, Set, Map);
- exceptions (standard, custom);
- principles of OOP;
- interfaces, enums, abstract classes;
- type conversion;
